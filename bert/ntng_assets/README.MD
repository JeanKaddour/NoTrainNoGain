# Reproducing NTNG results
In this directory, we provide some of the files to exactly reproduce the BERT results of our paper.

## C4 Random Subset
We provide the random subset of C4 which can be downloaded by running `python ntng_assets/download_c4_subset.py`.

## Irreducible Losses (RHO-Loss)
We provide the extracted irreducible losses collected from a proxy model in `python ntng_assets/download_il_losses.py`.
